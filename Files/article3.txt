Do you know that…? ;
... Sun protection products are recommended for use all year round, not only in the summer.;
Even when the sky is cloudy, the is about 40% of the solar radiation reach the ground. In this case, the UV-B still affect the skin, accelerating its wilting. The habit to use sun protection all year round came to us from the Asian countries, where products of decorative cosmetics with SPF were created.
… The SPF of any level of protection is fully effective only the first two hours, after which the degree of protection falls. Thus, it is recommended to resume a layer of the product regularly.
… High-SPF products ingredients may pose health risks such as tissue damage, allergic reactions and potential hormone disruption. 
The FDA has long contended that SPF higher than 50 is "inherently misleading" (FDA 2007). Australian authorities cap SPF values at 30; European and Japanese regulators at 50 (Osterwalder 2009b), and Canada allows a maximum of "50+". In 2011, the FDA proposed a regulation to prohibit labels higher than SPF 50+, but the agency has not completed work on this rule and put it into force. EWG believes that FDA must cap values at 50+.
