Flights;
During the flight, the skin experiences stress. Due to the low level of air humidity on board (15%), the differences in atmospheric pressure and immobility of passengers during the flight in the skin cells slows metabolism, they cease to receive the proper amount of vitamins and minerals.;
How to deal with it?
- Moisturizing mask before flight.
Any moisturizing procedure will help the skin survive this stress. If the flight is long, it makes sense to take a tissue mask with you. At least using the cream and patches for the eyes on the board, you have not surprised anyone for a long time.
- Thorough cleaning on arrival.
The second problem after dry air is the air conditioning system, which is quite dirty usually. It is better to direct it away from yourself - so you can avoid both inflammation and extra dryness. However, especially cleanse the face is in any case.
- Special attention to the means used on board.
Bloggers introduced the fashion to thermal waters and mines. Their action illuminates and the craving to spray the life-giving moisture on the person suffering from dryness is great. However, many of them contain salt in the composition, and some even alcohol - ingredients, which will exacerbate the problem. If you want to use balms or creams in the plane - it will only benefit, but it is worth choosing products on a fat basis.
- The most important point.
This applies not only to the skin. It is important to understand what happens to your body during the flight. Distracted by thoughts about business or long-awaited vacation, we do not record the changes that are taking place. Metabolism and all other processes slow down and the body spends a lot of energy on maintaining itself. Excessive leaks on food will worsen the situation - digestion will take too much energy and it will worsen the overall condition. It is better to give preference to liquid food and clean water. Alcohol and coffee are especially harmful in this situation, as they will dehydrate the body even more.
