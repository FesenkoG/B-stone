The skin and the makeup;
What needs to be known to avoid problems.;
- Do not go to sleep with your makeup.
This might lead to inflammations, allergic reactions, dryness etc., as cosmetic's formulas are not planned to be applied to the skin for so long (the most long wearing products are usually about 16h to stay).
- Hygiene.
The main rule is : cosmetics is for personal usage, there should not be any common products. Even with you relative or a best friend. Makeup artist are forced to use the same product on various people, but they all (I mean all good professionals) use special disinfectants and they never put the product directly from the package to the skin, there are special tools for it. Lipsticks, pencils, mascara's brushes - all these needs to be your own, other way the bacteria spread is inevitably. Also look after your brushes - there should be no dust or dirt on it, so wash it everyday and storage in a right way.
- A proper cleansing.
The most of the modern makeup products are needs to be removed by several steps. Especially it concerns products with silicons, talk or comedogenic oils in, as it accumulates in pores and causes inflammations.
