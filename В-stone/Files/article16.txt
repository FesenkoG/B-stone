Basic rules for everyone;
Something basic you need to know;
1. Regularity
The main facial care must be done every day in the morning and in the evening. It takes no more than 3 minutes and should become the same habit as brushing your teeth.
2. Hygiene
Clean hands! When you apply the cream, picking it from the jar with dirty hands, you transfer the bacteria to both the face and the cream, which is a perfect habitat for their reproduction.
3. Temperature mode
In order for the cream to absorb well and activate its properties, it is necessary to warm it up beforehand to body temperature.
4. Dosage
There is no need to save or apply too much cream. The amount of cream should be optimal - it is good to moisturize the skin, but do not lie overweight, preventing its breathing. Therefore, if after 20-30 minutes the cream is not absorbed into the skin, the excess should be soaked with a napkin.
5. Absorption rate
Day cream should be applied no later than half an hour before going out, and in winter not later than an hour, so that it can absorb. Night cream should be applied no later than an hour before bedtime. You can and 2-3 hours. Because while your muscles are mobile, the cream will absorb well and will do its job. And if you apply the cream and then go to bed - your muscles relax, microcirculation is broken, the cream stagnates and in the morning it can provoke the appearance of edema, especially in the eye area.
