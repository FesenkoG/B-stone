Dry and prone to dryness skin;
This skin, which is lacking moisture, is usually thin and prone to irritation. What features should be in this type of skin care?;
-  Cleansing
Avoid aggressive highly foaming or alcohol-containing products, prefer creamy textures, cleansing lotions and balms.
-  Exfoliation
For owners of dry skin acid peels are more preferable, than scrubs and peeling abrasive. In dry skin, the ability to regenerate is reduced, so irritations and micro-traumas from such remedies are critical for it.
-  Moistening
For those who lack moisture, the skin is a particularly important stage. Do not neglect creams, moisturizing serums, do masks once a week and as needed. Remember that the skin condition is a reflection of the internal health of the body, so watch your food and drink plenty of water.
