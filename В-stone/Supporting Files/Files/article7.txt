How to deal with inflammations?;
Universal Basic Rules:
- Hygiene!;
If inflammation is your constant problem, it's worth to keep a close eye on purity. Change the pillowcases more often, wipe the screen of the mobile phone before attaching it to the face, do not touch the face with unwashed hands. Carefully follow the purity of makeup brushes. We also recommend replacing cloth face with disposable paper towels.
- The appropriate diet.
Acne, especially in the lower part of the face, is often caused by problems with the digestive system. It is necessary to reduce consumption of fast food, fermented milk products and fatty foods, also a session of detox and cleaning the intestines is recommended. As soon as the body comes back to normal, a strict diet can be weaken and it is ok to pamper yourself with your favorite food, but anyway it is better not to bring to a new exacerbation.
- The regular care
A common mistake in skin care for skin prone to inflammation is overdrying.
Too frequent washings and aggressive cleansing agents provoke further development of the problem. Overdried skin will produce more sebum, which in turn is an ideal environment for the multiplication of bacteria, which will lead to new inflammations! Watch for the hydration of your skin, cleanse regularly, feed and tonify it.
- Medicine.
Acne is often confused with dermatitis or an allergic reaction. In addition, inflammation can be associated with diseases of internal organs and hormonal failures, so the best way is to consult a doctor to rule out the possibility of serious diseases!
