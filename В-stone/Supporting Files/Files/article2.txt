How to choose SPF?;
The exposure of the skin to UV rays depends on its phototype. The simplest way is to focus on the skin color: as lighter the skin is - than more dangerous the sun is for it. However, basic protection is recommended for everyone.
Sunscreens are divided into the following groups:;
SPF 2-4 - basic protection, protects from 50-75% UV
SPF 4-10 - medium protection, protects from 85% UV
SPF 10-20 - high protection, protects from 95% UV
SPF 20-30 - intensive protection, protects from 97% UV
SPF 50 - sunblock, protects from 99.5% of UV
Therefore, the difference between cream with SPF 30 and SPF 50 is very small.
