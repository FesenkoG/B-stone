Skin care for smokers;
Because of smoking the collagen (the protein provides elasticity of the skin) collapses, so early wrinkles may appear, especially around the mouth and eyes. It can also be the cause of swelling, lack of natural blush and a uniform complexion, as smoking reduces the vitamin E and C content and narrows the blood vessels. Direct exposure to tobacco smoke on the face causes dryness and constant irritation due to toxic substances contained in the smoke.

- Thorough cleansing
It is worth paying special attention to scrubs and pilings. The frequent contact of smoke with the skin leads to accelerated keratinization of cells. The layer of these cells prevents penetration of useful substances into living cells; therefore, it is necessary to follow their removal. Choose a product for such procedures according to sensitivity and hydration level of the skin.
- Blood circulation stimulating.
Active substances that stimulate blood circulation: vitamin A, fruit acids, collagens, elastins. Cosmetologist does most of such procedures with using these substances; however, home care products can also contain these ingredients. Masks with a warming effect can also be useful. It is worth remembering that such a procedure reveals the pores, after which they must be closed with a cold wash or a tonic. Daily self-massage with a suitable cosmetic oil is also an extremely recommended procedure.

The practice of making such sheet masks daily in the morning also is widespread and helps to maintain the appearance of the skin.
