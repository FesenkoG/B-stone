Baby it's cold outside!;
What happens to our skin when the temperature outside decreases and how to protect it?;

Thus, we are faced with a large temperature drop when leaving the room, with excessive dryness of the air in the room and with frost in the street. All this stress for the body, including for the skin of the face. Even oily skin can begin to peel, become sensitive and irritable, prone to frequent redness and even itching and cracks. What tools and procedures can help?
1) A more saturated moistening
2) Protective barrier, cream without alcohol
